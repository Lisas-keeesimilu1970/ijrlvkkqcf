Man, just finished watching A Working Man. You know when a movie just kinda hits you right in the feels? That's what happened here. It's like, for real, these stories about grappling with job stuff and identity crises are too relatable, you know? But I can’t decide if I’m super inspired or just annoyed by how real it is! Ha!

Dude, the main guy just gets this look on his face sometimes, like he's holding the universe on one shoulder and pizza coupons on the other, trying to choose which matters more. It's wild! And seriously, the part where he just stands there staring into space, I was like, Yeah, I've been there, like every Monday of my life. 😂

Oh, oh! There was this scene where they're all striking or whatever, and he’s just… there... like, Is this all there is? Major mood! It's funny 'cause it kinda makes you want to just go download the movie and rewatch to catch all the things you missed while spacing out or whatever. The dialogue is sorta subtle like that... like it sneaks up on you, you know?

> Speaking of watching, I had to legit be like focus, dude. Watch the movie, don't just vibe with the soundtrack! Because, let me tell you, the music? Absolute perfection. Like the perfect mix of get your act together and just chill out, man, like they know exactly how to mess with your head. 😂

And can we just talk about how the guy's boss is just this... platonic ideal of a boss everyone’s had at some job? It’s like, where did they find this person? Straight outta central casting for “most predictable corporate suit ever.” Classic!

Random thought: Why does everyone in these films live in these too-perfect little towns? Like, do they exist? I need to find a place like that, where drama is neatly contained in plotlines and every character gets a nice resolution in the end. But hey, that's why it's a movie, right? In real life, we just get emails and existential dread. 😂

string randomPlaceHolder = I have no idea what I'm doing here;

But yeah, I left feeling like I need to go do something epic – then realized I just wanted to nap. Life, amirite? Anyway, tell me what you think if you ever watch it. Or download it. Whatever. 🤷‍♂️
